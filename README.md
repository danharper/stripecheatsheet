# Stripe Test Cards in Dash

![](http://i.imgur.com/o6JrII0.png)

How?

Dash > Preferences > Downloads > "All Docsets" > +

add this URL:

```
http://danharper.me/dash_feeds/stripe.xml
```

Then press "Download" when it pops into the list of available docsets.

Will add to the "user contributed" repo at some point, just looked like a pain at first glance.
